Netflix, Inc. is an American technology and media services provider and production company headquartered in Los Gatos, California.  The company's primary business is its subscription-based streaming service, which offers online streaming of a library of films and television series, including those produced in-house. It is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 10000 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 222M Subscribers globally. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc


I have analyzed the data and generated insights that could help Netflix in deciding which type of shows/movies to produce and how they can grow the business in different countries.
