Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 10000 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 222M Subscribers globally. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc
